Record of Interactions with Client 
-----------------------------------

2pm meeting with client Notes: 10/7/18

* Needs: no platform currently for catering for customers, bigger clients, corporate clients that spend fair bit of money
* Current process- order what they want as long as couple days notice - as long as sufficiently staffed
* We confirm by email take payment over phone - credit card and then drive the food out to them at a certain time
* Whycatering don’t use online system; head office charge 3% on any orders go through their system
  * No way to utilise it in a way that gives us any notice - if someone wants fifty items going to have to put extra staff on
  * No delivery attached to that
  * Currently they order x amount we will do delivery for free
  * Min quantity -
  * Solution: geographical- log in - if they are within that area free delivery, if outside not free
  * Payment system? Doesn’t mind paying over phone still
  * Biggest befiit wants is allowing people to have multiple logins that other people can use- eg staff can add onto it
  * Or just an id they can type in and see what orders are on that id
* The person that has the login - eg ui insurance - this is your login that you can use- that person can start an order- generates login - goes around - others login and add onto it
* The person initiated order would have to be the one to submit that order at the end - only them
* And something to calculate their distance to check if they are in range or out of range
  * Drive time
* Discount in buying in bulk- meet min thresholds
* If people have modifications - guacamole add ons etc
* <quana@gym.com.au>- use his email address while testing it - text message reminder that you don’t miss it - eg new order come in from x



1pm meeting with client Notes: 16/7/18

* Alex the client came in for lunch to review the proposal for the website
* Agreed that the app would be catered towards large clients

Application Design 
===================

Summary of Application
----------------------

**Problem defenition**: there is currently an online ordering system for gyg, however the client tells us there is no way to use this system to offer discounts for larger clients. The current online system also does not allow notice because customers can only choose to order for that day. This is a problem for the client because if a large client places a large order for that day the client has to put more staff on to cater for the higher demand. The client would like a platform where large clients can order three days in advance. This will give our client more notice so that he can add more staff on and gather the necessary resources rather than rushing.

**Problem Solution:** We will be building an online ordering process for GyG Kawana. This system will be targeted towards the larger clients of GYG. Through the app they can place their food orders. This order will then be sent off to our client through email or text. He can then call the company or business who ordered the food and sort payment over the phone. Our client told us he would prefer payment over the phone.

Review of Conceptual Design and Edit Based on Feedback
------------------------------------------------------

The client is happy with the proposal however base don feedback for the problem solution the client also suggested that he would like to be notified by text or email when an incoming order arrives. He also suggested that large clients should be offered a discount on bulk orders from GyG. These proposals were put forward and would become part of the conceptual design of the app.
